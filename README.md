# Animated Image Gallery

- In this project I built an image gallery using HTML5 markup.
- I used JQuery plugin 'Quicksand' to achieve animation when clicking on a new gallery.
- When a photo is clicked, a lightbox will open up along with arrows to scroll through the gallery images.
  I used the 'Fancybox' plugin for this.
